Installing the calendar-cli
===========================

No packaging available yet; it's just to copy the python executable into the path, i.e. /usr/local/bin

There are two dependencies;

* icalendar library - I've used https://pypi.python.org/pypi/icalendar
* caldav library - I've used http://trac.calendarserver.org/wiki/CalDAVClientLibrary - but I'm strongly considering to switch to https://pypi.python.org/pypi/caldav

All of those are under development and has to be installed manually.
