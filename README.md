calendar-cli
============

Simple command-line CalDav client, for adding and browsing calendar items, todo list items, etc

Rationale
---------

GUIs and Web-UIs are nice for some purposes, but I really find the command line unbeatable when it comes to:

* Minor stuff that are repeated often.  Writing something like "todo add make a calendar-cli system" or "cal add 2013-09-16 13:00 2h doctor appointment" is just very much faster than navigating into some web calendar interface and add an item there.
* Things that are outside the scope of the UI.  Here is one of many tasks I'd like to do: "go through the work calendar, find all new calendar events that are outside office hours, check up with the personal calendar if there are potential conflicts, add some information at the personal calendar if appropriate", and vice versa - it has to be handled very manually if doing it through any normal calendar application as far as I know, but if having some simple CLI or python library I could easily make some interactive script that would help me doing the operation above.

I've been looking a bit around, all I could find was cadaver and CalDAVClientLibrary.  Both of those seems to be a bit shortcoming; they seem to miss the iCalendar parsing/generation.  CalDAVClientLibrary is already a python library, and there also exist python libraries for iCalendar parsing/generation, so all that seems to be missing is the "glue" between those libraries.

Objectives
----------

* It should be really easy and quick to add a todo-list item from the command line.
* It should be really easy and quick to add a calendar item from the command line.
* It should be possible to get out lists ("agenda") of calendar items and todo-items.
* Interface for copying calendar items between calendars, even between calendars on distinct caldav servers
